# Node.js fs Module Example

This example demonstrates how to use Node.js's `fs` module from Husk using extern type declarations generated by the `dts2-extern` command.

## How this example was created

1. Created a new Husk project:
   ```bash
   husk new fs-example
   ```

2. Converted the Node.js fs type definitions directly from a URL:
   ```bash
   cd fs-example
   husk dts2-extern https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/master/types/node/fs.d.ts -o src/fs-types.husk
   ```

This generated a complete `fs-types.husk` file with all the extern declarations needed to use the fs module.

## What the example demonstrates

The `main.husk` file shows how to:
- Check if files exist using `fs.existsSync()`
- Write files with `fs.writeFileSync()`
- Read files with `fs.readFileSync()`
- Get file statistics with `fs.statSync()`
- List directory contents with `fs.readdirSync()`
- Create directories with `fs.mkdirSync()`
- Remove files and directories with `fs.unlinkSync()` and `fs.rmdirSync()`
- Work with JSON data using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`

## Running the example

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   husk build
   ```

2. Run with Node.js:
   ```bash
   cd dist
   node main.js
   ```

## Key takeaways

- The `dts2-extern` command can convert TypeScript declaration files directly from URLs
- The generated extern declarations provide type-safe access to JavaScript libraries
- Complex Node.js APIs like the fs module work seamlessly with Husk
- The full fs API is available, not just a simplified subset
