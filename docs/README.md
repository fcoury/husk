## üöÄ Quick Start

Husk is a modern programming language that combines the safety and expressiveness of Rust with the simplicity needed for both learning and production use. It features:

- **Static typing** with type inference
- **Pattern matching** for expressive control flow
- **First-class functions** and closures
- **Memory safety** without manual management
- **JavaScript compilation** for web deployment

### Example Code

```husk
// Define a function with pattern matching
fn greet(name: string) -> string {
    match name {
        "World" => "Hello, World! üåç",
        "" => "Hello, anonymous!",
        _ => format!("Hello, {}!", name)
    }
}

// Use higher-order functions
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let evens = numbers.filter(|n| n % 2 == 0);
let doubled = evens.map(|n| n * 2);

println!("Doubled evens: {:?}", doubled); // [4, 8]

// Safe file operations with Result handling
match read_file("config.json") {
    Ok(contents) => {
        let config = parse_json(contents);
        println!("Loaded configuration");
    },
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to load config: {}", e)
}
```
