# Husk Language Design Decisions and Implementation TODOs

This document tracks design decisions made during development and features that need to be implemented or improved.

## Design Decisions

### 1. If as Expression (Implemented)
- **Decision**: Treat `if` as an expression everywhere, not as a statement
- **Rationale**: Provides consistency and eliminates the artificial distinction between if statements and if expressions
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Notes**: Similar to Rust, Kotlin, and Scala

### 2. Parentheses in Expressions (Implemented)
- **Decision**: Support parentheses for grouping expressions
- **Rationale**: Essential for controlling operator precedence and expression clarity
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 3. Pattern Variable Scoping (Implemented)
- **Decision**: Pattern variables in match expressions should be available in the match arm body without creating a new scope
- **Rationale**: Makes pattern matching more useful and intuitive
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

## Implementation TODOs

### High Priority

#### 1. Logical Operators (Implemented)
- **Features**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: Full boolean operations now available
- **Example**: `if x > 5 && x < 10 { ... }`
- **Notes**: 
  - Includes short-circuit evaluation
  - Proper operator precedence (AND higher than OR)
  - Type-safe: requires boolean operands

#### 2. Comparison Operators (Implemented)
- **Features**: `!=` (not equals)
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: All standard comparisons now supported
- **Example**: `if x != 0 { ... }`
- **Notes**: Works with all comparable types (int, float, bool, string, enum)

#### 3. Compound Assignment Operators (Implemented)
- **Features**: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented for all assignable targets
- **Working**: 
  - Simple variables: `x += 1`, `sum += value`
  - Array elements: `arr[0] += 1`
  - Struct fields: `point.x += 5`
- **Note**: Nested access like `rect.top_left.x += 10` has parsing limitations
- **Implementation**: Extended interpreter to handle all compound assignment targets

#### 4. Unary Operators (Implemented)
- **Features**: `-` (negation), `!` (logical NOT)
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: Can now express negative numbers and boolean negation
- **Example**: `-1`, `!condition`, `--5` (double negation)
- **Notes**: Supports chaining and works in all expression contexts

#### 5. Method Call Syntax (Implemented)
- **Features**: Automatic `self` passing for method calls like `object.method()`
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: Both `Type::method(object)` and `object.method()` syntax work correctly
- **Example**: Both `Rectangle::area(rect)` and `rect.area()` work
- **Notes**: 
  - Supports both static and instance methods
  - Handles method references (`Type::method`) vs calls (`Type::method()`)
  - Proper type checking with struct name compatibility

### Medium Priority

#### 6. Complex Lvalue Support for Compound Assignment (Implemented)
- **Features**: Support compound assignment for array elements and struct fields
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: All compound assignment operators now work with complex lvalue expressions
- **Examples**:
  - Array: `arr[i] += 1` ‚úÖ Now works
  - Struct: `point.x *= 2` ‚úÖ Now works
  - All operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` supported
- **Implementation**:
  - Extended `visit_compound_assign` to handle `Expr::ArrayIndex`
  - Extended `visit_compound_assign` to handle `Expr::MemberAccess`
  - Reused assignment logic from regular assignment for consistency

#### 7. Mutable Variables
- **Features**: `mut` keyword for explicit mutability
- **Current Status**: All variables are mutable by default
- **Impact**: No way to enforce immutability
- **Design Question**: Should we make variables immutable by default (like Rust) or keep current behavior?

#### 7. Anonymous Functions / Closures
- **Features**: `fn(args) -> ret { body }` syntax for anonymous functions
- **Current Status**: Not implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot create higher-order functions or closures
- **Example**: `let add = fn(a: int, b: int) -> int { a + b };`

#### 8. String Concatenation
- **Features**: String concatenation with `+` operator
- **Current Status**: Not implemented
- **Impact**: No way to concatenate strings
- **Example**: `"hello" + " world"`

#### 9. Self Type in Methods (Implemented)
- **Features**: Proper handling of `self` type in method signatures
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Impact**: Method implementations work correctly with proper self type resolution
- **Example**: `fn area(self) -> int` correctly accepts `Rectangle` instances
- **Notes**: Fixed together with method call syntax implementation

### Low Priority

#### 10. If Expressions in Any Position
- **Current Status**: If expressions work but were initially limited in where they could appear
- **Notes**: This was partially addressed by making if always an expression

## Type System Improvements
