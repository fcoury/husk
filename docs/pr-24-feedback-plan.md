# PR #24 Feedback Implementation Plan

This document tracks the feedback received on PR #24 (npm improvements - import maps, tree shaking, and dev/prod mode) and our plan to address each item.

## Priority 1: Required Actions Before Merge

### 1. Repository Cleanup
**Feedback**: PR includes unnecessary files that should be cleaned up
- [x] Remove `src/lib.rs.bak` - backup file
- [x] Remove `src/transpiler_target_modes_test.rs.bak` - backup file  
- [x] Remove root-level test files:
  - [x] `test_cjs.husk`
  - [x] `test_no_main.husk`
  - [x] `test_module.rs`
  - [x] `test_transpiler_output.husk`
- [x] Remove test project directories from root:
  - [x] `test_cjs_project/`
  - [x] `test_missing_main/`
  - [x] Move test projects to appropriate test directory if needed

### 2. Security: Import Map URL Validation
**Feedback**: URLs are used directly without validation, potential security risk
- [x] Add URL validation in `config.rs:validate()` method
- [x] Validate that URLs start with `http://`, `https://`, `/`, or `./`
- [x] Return configuration error for invalid URLs
- [x] Add tests for URL validation

### 3. Tree Shaking: Adjust Pure Function List
**Feedback**: Some functions marked as pure might have side effects
- [x] Remove `Math.random` from pure functions list (has RNG state side effects)
- [x] Consider handling `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` separately (can throw)
- [ ] Document which functions are considered pure and why

## Priority 2: Documentation Improvements

### 1. Main Documentation
- [x] Add configuration examples to main README
- [x] Document feature interactions:
  - [x] Tree shaking automatically disabled in dev mode
  - [x] Import maps take precedence over package resolution
  - [x] How external deps interact with import maps
- [x] Document import map security considerations

### 2. Feature Precedence Documentation
- [ ] Document the precedence order of import resolution
- [ ] Add examples showing how different features interact

## Priority 3: Performance Optimizations

### 1. Pure Annotation Checking
**Feedback**: String matching in `should_add_pure_annotation` could be optimized
- [ ] Replace string matching with HashSet for O(1) lookups
- [ ] Pre-populate HashSet with pure function names

### 2. Import Map Caching
**Feedback**: Consider caching for import map lookups in hot paths
- [ ] Analyze performance impact of current implementation
- [ ] Implement caching if benchmarks show significant benefit

## Priority 4: Enhanced Features

### 1. Development Mode Enhancements
- [ ] Add configuration option to control verbosity of dev mode comments
- [ ] Extend runtime type checking to include null/undefined checks
- [ ] Consider adding source map support for better debugging

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Add more descriptive error messages for import map failures
- [ ] Improve error context for tree shaking annotation failures

## Implementation Status

| 2 | Main Documentation | âœ… Completed | Added examples for all new features |
| 2 | Feature Precedence Docs | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Documented interactions, need import resolution order |
| 3 | Pure Annotation Optimization | ðŸ”´ Not Started | |
| 3 | Import Map Caching | ðŸ”´ Not Started | |
| 4 | Dev Mode Enhancements | ðŸ”´ Not Started | |
| 4 | Error Handling | ðŸ”´ Not Started | |

## Notes

- Both reviewers praised the overall quality, test coverage, and implementation
- The feedback is mostly about enhancements rather than critical issues
- Priority 1 items should be completed before merging
- Priority 2-4 items can be addressed in follow-up PRs

## Review Comments Summary

### Positive Feedback
- Excellent test coverage with dedicated test files for each feature
- Clean integration with existing configuration structure
- Smart feature interactions (e.g., tree shaking disabled in dev mode)
- Follows Rust best practices and proper error handling
- Comprehensive integration tests

### Areas for Improvement
- Security considerations for import maps
- Repository cleanup needed
- Minor adjustments to tree shaking logic
- Documentation enhancements
- Performance optimizations (optional)
