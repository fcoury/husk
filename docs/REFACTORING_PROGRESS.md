# Husk Architecture Refactoring Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of the Husk language refactoring effort based on the plan outlined in `ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md`.

## Overall Progress: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)

### âœ… Completed Tasks

#### 1.1 Type System Overhaul âœ…
- [x] Created `src/types/mod.rs` with Type enum and related types
- [x] Implemented TypeEnvironment for managing type bindings
- [x] Created basic type utility methods (`to_string`, `from_string`)
- [x] Updated AST nodes to carry type information
- [x] Migrated all string-based type checks to use new system
- [x] Integrated TypeEnvironment into SemanticAnalyzer
- [x] Fixed scoping issues with manual push/pop instead of ScopeGuard
- [x] All existing tests pass with new type system

**Status**: 100% Complete

#### Type System Design Decisions âœ…
- [x] Type Inference Level: Local type inference
- [x] Generic Types: Prepare architecture, implement later
- [x] Type Aliases: Simple type aliases
- [x] Null/Option Types: Rust-style Option and Result types
- [x] Type Coercion: No automatic coercion

**Status**: 100% Complete (Documented in `TYPE_SYSTEM_DECISIONS.md`)

### âœ… Completed Tasks in Phase 1

#### 1.2 AST Visitor Pattern (100% Complete) âœ…
- [x] Create `src/ast/visitor.rs` with visitor traits
- [x] Implement default traversal methods
- [x] Update visitor trait for semicolon tracking
- [x] Refactor semantic analyzer to use visitor pattern âœ…
- [x] Refactor interpreter to use visitor pattern âœ…
- [x] Refactor transpiler to use visitor pattern âœ…

**Updated Decision (2024-12-29)**: Visitor pattern implementation is now the highest priority. After analysis, we determined that completing the visitor pattern first will make the expression-based language transformation cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone. The visitor pattern will centralize all AST traversal logic, making it easier to implement consistent expression semantics across all components.

#### 1.4 Typed AST Implementation (100% Complete) âœ… - NEW
- [x] Design typed AST structure with distinct semantic nodes
- [x] Implement AST transformer using semantic information
- [x] Create typed transpiler for clean code generation
- [x] Properly disambiguate EnumVariant vs StaticMethodCall
- **Note**: This wasn't in the original plan but became necessary to properly handle semantic distinctions

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks for Phase 1

#### 1.3 Lexer Performance Optimization (0% Complete)
- [ ] Rewrite lexer to use byte-based approach
- [ ] Add proper Unicode support with char boundary tracking
- [ ] Implement zero-copy token creation where possible
- [ ] Add lexer benchmarks to track performance
- [ ] Optimize keyword recognition with perfect hashing

### Testing & Validation for Phase 1
- [x] Unit tests for Type system
- [x] Unit tests for TypeEnvironment
- [ ] Property-based tests for type system invariants
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing improvement
- [x] All existing tests must pass

## ðŸ†• Phase 1.5: Expression-Based Language Transformation (Added)

**Status**: In Progress - Paused for Visitor Pattern Completion (see `EXPRESSION_BASED_LANGUAGE_PLAN.md`)

This is a major architectural change to make Husk a fully expression-based language like Rust. This wasn't in the original plan but is crucial for achieving Rust-like semantics.

**Implementation Order Change**: We've decided to complete the visitor pattern implementation first (Phase 1.2) before continuing with expression-based features. This will provide a cleaner foundation for the complex AST transformations required.

### Core Expression Semantics (14% Complete - 1/7 tasks)
- [x] Add semicolon tracking to AST and Parser âœ…
- [ ] Update parser for expression blocks (waiting for visitor pattern)
- [ ] Make all Stmt analysis return Type (waiting for visitor pattern)
- [ ] Implement block type inference (waiting for visitor pattern)
- [ ] Update semantic analyzer for expression semantics (waiting for visitor pattern)
- [ ] Make all statement evaluation return Value (waiting for visitor pattern)
- [ ] Update transpiler for JS compatibility (waiting for visitor pattern)

### Language Refinements (0% Complete)
- [ ] Break with values in loops
- [ ] If-let and while-let expressions
- [ ] Pattern matching improvements
- [ ] Result/Option ? operator

### Migration Support (0% Complete)
- [ ] Migration guide documentation
- [ ] Update all existing tests
- [ ] Update all examples
- [ ] Consider compatibility mode

**Priority**: HIGH - This fundamentally changes the language semantics and should be done before proceeding with other refactoring tasks.

## Implementation Notes

### Type System Integration Details
The type system integration touched many files but was completed successfully:

1. **Core Type System** (`src/types/`):
   - `mod.rs`: Type enum with all Husk types
   - `environment.rs`: Scoped type bindings management

2. **SemanticAnalyzer Updates**:
   - Replaced all string-based type representations
   - Integrated TypeEnvironment for proper scoping
   - Updated all expression and statement analysis

3. **Design Decisions Made**:
   - Local type inference only (for now)
   - Architecture ready for generics (not implemented)
   - Simple type aliases planned
   - Option/Result types planned
   - No automatic type coercion

### Next Recommended Steps

1. **Complete Visitor Pattern** - This is now the highest priority. Completing the visitor pattern will provide a clean foundation for implementing expression-based semantics and all future language features.

2. **Expression-Based Language Transformation** - After visitor pattern is complete, resume the expression-based language transformation with a much cleaner implementation approach.

3. **Lexer Optimization** - Current O(n) character access is a performance bottleneck that should be addressed.

4. **Start planning Phase 2** - Especially error recovery in the parser, which will significantly improve developer experience.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Borrow Checker Constraints**: The RAII ScopeGuard pattern didn't work well with Rust's borrow checker. Manual scope management was simpler and cleaner.

2. **Incremental Migration**: The ability to convert between old string types and new Type enum (`Type::from_string`) was crucial for gradual migration.

3. **Test Coverage**: Having good integration tests made the refactoring much safer. All tests continued to pass throughout the migration.

## Metrics

### Code Quality Improvements
- âœ… Zero string-based type comparisons (was: ~50+)
- âœ… Centralized type system (was: scattered across codebase)
- âœ… Type-safe enum matching (was: error-prone string matching)

### Performance (To Be Measured)
- [ ] Lexer: Target 10x faster on large files
- [ ] Parser: Target 5x faster with error recovery
- [ ] Type checking: Expected 2-3x faster with enum matching
